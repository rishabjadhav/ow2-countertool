# Overwatch 2 Counter Tool
The intention of this counterpick tool is to serve as a guide to Overwatch 2 players that seek to counterpick their opponents to win games. The site contains two sections:

### Hero Page
The hero page contains every hero currently avaliable to play in Overwatch 2. When a hero is selected, the hero's name, role, and designation appear.
Additionally, counterpick information is shown: what heroes a certain hero is effective against, and who they are countered by.

### Team Page
The team builder page allows you to input the enemy team's composition, and in turn get a suggested team composition to most effectively counter.
If an enemy tank is specified by the user, the suggested team composition is centered around countering that tank.
Otherwise, the playstyle designations (brawl, poke, dive) are counted among enemy heroes, and the majority designation will be chosen to determine a counter team.
